# CheesyGame-Unity2D
The game consists of two parts. The first part is for one player, a mouse trying to eat a piece of cheese, which gives him ten points while avoiding falling into one of the three traps that move every period of time, knowing that the mouse has three chances to die, with a random box that appears and disappears every period of time And this box either has a nice gift, which is to increase the speed of the mouse, or a bad gift, which is to reduce the speed of the mouse And the second part of the game is for two players, the Two-Player play in the same area and compete in the speed of eating a piece of cheese before the other mouse while also avoiding falling into the trap and trying to try their luck in taking the random box and the mouse that dies first is the loser
